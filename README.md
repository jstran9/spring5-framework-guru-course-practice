# Spring5-Framework-Guru-Course-Practice

Although provided by jt, I am creating this repository to practice Git more and using branches and merging an old repository into this one.

The prior merged repository does not have multiple branches (lacks a good practice there) but I will be creating new branches for each added feature in the Spring Framework 5 - Beginner to Guru course.
